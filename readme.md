# Diploma Thesis

Three implementations of a library used for routing linear algebra sub-problems in multi-GPU systems (with communication - computation overlap).

## Implementations

1. **CUDA** version

2. **POSIX threads** version

3. **HIP** version (AMD)

## Details

Task queues and an event-based synchronization system are used. The latter implementations extend the applicability of the library and achieve similar or superior performance.
